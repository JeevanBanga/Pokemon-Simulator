# Pokemon-Simulator
This is a Pokemon interaction simulator! The user will input 2 pokemon names, their respective attack level, and whether they are friendly or not. The user is displayed with a menu of options:
1) Description of Pokemon 1
2) Description of Pokemon 2
3) Simulate the interaction between Pokemon 1 and 2
4) Quit Game

The 3rd simulation option has over 30 possible unique interactions between the 2 Pokemon depending on if they're friendly and how their attack levels compare with each other!

# Concepts used
- relatively complex program that uses multiple class objects that interact with each other.
- user input validation using while loops
- format strings used to inject object properties into strings and organize display for user
- Random.choice used to have multiple simulation outcomes for each scenario
- Methods defined within the class for pokemon objects to interact/compare properties
- lists used to organize simulation outcomes
